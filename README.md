# Factory Method Design Pattern

## What is the Factory Method Design Pattern?

The Factory Method design pattern is a creational pattern that provides an interface for creating objects, but allows subclasses to decide which class to instantiate. It promotes loose coupling by encapsulating the creation of objects behind an interface.

## Benefits of the Factory Method Design Pattern

**1. Abstraction:** The client code doesn't need to know the specific implementation details of the objects it creates. It only needs to interact with the abstract factory interface.

**2. Flexibility:** The factory can create different types of objects based on the client's needs, without the client having to know the details of how those objects are created.

**3. Extensibility:** Adding new product types is easy, as it only requires creating a new concrete factory and product class, without modifying the existing code.

**4. Testability:** The factory can be mocked or stubbed during testing, making it easier to test the client code that uses the factory.

## Example: Payment Processing System

Imagine you are building a payment processing system for an e-commerce platform. The system needs to support multiple payment gateways, such as PayPal, Stripe, and Apple Pay. You want to create a flexible and extensible design that allows you to add new payment gateways without modifying the existing code.

In this scenario, we can use the Factory Method design pattern to create the payment gateway objects.

In this example, the **PaymentGateway** interface defines the contract for all payment gateways, and the **PayPalGateway**, **StripeGateway**, and **ApplePayGateway** classes are the concrete implementations of this interface.

The **PaymentGatewayFactory** class is the creator that provides the **createPaymentGateway()** method, which is responsible for creating the appropriate PaymentGateway instance based on the provided gateway type.
